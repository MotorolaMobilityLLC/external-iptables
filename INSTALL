FOLLOW THESE STEPS:

0) There may be some outstanding bugfixes or tweaks which are not yet
   in the official kernel.  Those are now (as of iptables-1.2.7) kept
   in a seperate package, called patch-o-matic.  It is available from
   ftp://ftp.netfilter.org/pub/patch-o-matic/

1) Next, make the package. If you use a standard distribution kernel,
   just run ./configure.

   If you want to build against an own kernel tree:

	$ ./configure --with-kernel=/home/jengelh/mykernel

   or whereever you put it. If you are using a dedicated kernel build
   directory, you use:

	$ ./configure --with-kbuild=<<where-built>> --with-ksource=<<source>>

2) Finally, you need to install the binaries and shared libraries:

	# make install

That's it!
================================================================
PROBLEMS YOU MAY ENCOUNTER:

1) This package requires a 2.4.4 kernel, or above.

2) If you get the kernel directory wrong, you may get compile failures.

3) If you want to specify alternate directories for installation
(instead of /usr/local/ bin lib man), do this:

	$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
	$ make
	# make install

4) The make process will automatically build a multipurpose binary under the
   names iptables-multi and ip6tables-multi.

5) If you want to build a statically linked version of the iptables binary,
   without the need for loading the plugins at runtime (e.g. for an embedded
   device or router-on-a-disk), please use

	$ ./configure --enable-static

   which will build both a semi-static multi binary (iptables-mtss, uses
   libc but not plugins) and a fully static multi binary (iptables-static).

6) If you want to install libipq (old interface), add --enable-devel to
   ./configure.
