FOLLOW THESE STEPS:
===================

Make sure /usr/src/linux contains the kernel headers you're building
against.  If /usr/src/linux is an older kernel, set the KERNEL_DIR
environment variable to point to the current kernel sources.

If you forget the above step, a bogus dependency files with a ".d"
extension may be created.  If you see messages like:
	make: *** No rule to make target `include/linux/netfilter_ipv4/ipt_limit.h',
	needed by `iptables.d'.  Stop.

then you have these bogus dependency files. Do this:

	% make distclean

To build, just do:

	% make

Finally, you need to to install the shared libraries, and the binary:

	# make install

If you want to specify alternate directories for installation (instead
of /usr/local/  bin lib man), do this:

	% make BINDIR=/usr/bin LIBDIR=/usr/lib MANDIR=/usr/man
	% make BINDIR=/usr/bin LIBDIR=/usr/lib MANDIR=/usr/man install

NOTE: make sure you build with at least the correct LIBDIR=
specification, otherwise iptables(8) won't know where to find the
dynamic objects.
