FOLLOW THESE STEPS:
===================
0) If you want to try some fun extensions, try:
	% make patch-o-matic KERNEL_DIR=<<where-your-kernel-is>>

1) If /usr/src/linux contains the kernel headers of a recent 2.4
   kernel:
	% make

   Otherwise:
	% make KERNEL_DIR=<<where-your-kernel-is>>

2) Finally, you need to to install the shared libraries, and the binary:
	# make install
   Or
	# make install KERNEL_DIR=<<where-your-kernel-is>>

That's it!
================
Problems you may encounter:

1) This package requires a 2.4.0 test9 kernel, or above.

2) If you get the kernel directory wrong, you may see a message like:
	Please try `make KERNEL_DIR=path-to-correct-kernel'

3) If you want to specify alternate directories for installation
(instead of /usr/local/ bin lib man), do this:

	% make BINDIR=/usr/bin LIBDIR=/usr/lib MANDIR=/usr/man
	# make BINDIR=/usr/bin LIBDIR=/usr/lib MANDIR=/usr/man install

NOTE: make sure you build with at least the correct LIBDIR=
specification, otherwise iptables(8) won't know where to find the
dynamic objects.


DEVELOPERS:
===========

0) If you wish to install iptables development libraries
   and related components, type:
   	% make install-devel
   	
Development libraries currently installed by the above are:
  libipq: Userspace packet queueing API
