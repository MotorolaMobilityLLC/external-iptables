Known bugs:

1) NAT in the OUTPUT chain does not work in stock kernels.  However,
   there is a patch in patch-o-matic, called the 'local-nat.patch'. 
   This patch adds a CONFIG_NF_IP_NAT_LOCAL kernel config option.

2) tcpdump traffic is corrupted by OUTPUT NAT.

3) Connection tracking doesn't wait very long for reply FIN, meaning
   that half-closed pipes can time out early (seen frequently with squid).
