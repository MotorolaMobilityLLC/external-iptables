TODO List for netfilter / iptables. 
Currently maintained by Harald Welte <laforge@gnumonks.org>

Please inform me, if you want to work on any of the TODO items, so I
can update this list and thus prevent two people doing the same work.

IMPORTANT issues:
- solution for nostate / notrack (we don't want to track specific conn's)
- multiple related connections [HW]
- ip_conntrack rmmod loop (sometimes, Yan's patch?)
- conntrack helper not called for first packet (udp!)
- why is nat_helper's expect() function called for all helpers?
X full tcp window tracking incompatibility with nat helpers [HW]
? Hard lockup with ip_queue under heavy load (was possibly some unrelated 2.3 problem) [JM]
- mangle table should use all five netfilter hooks [HW]
- merge EPRT / EPSV ftp stuff
X runme error with IPv6 stuff! [HW]
- wrong 'Out of window' error message from tcp-windowtracking [HW]
- SMP conntrack race [RR]

NICE to have:
- multicast connection tracking
- sysctl support for ftp-multi, irc-conntrack/nat, ftp-fxp
- integrate HOPLIMIT for ipv6 in patch-o-matic [HW]
- static 1:1 NAT (only ip address NAT in both directions)
- u32 classifier (port from tc -> iptables) [YU]
X pktlen match (not needed, when u32 available) [FM]
- MARK match / target with boolean OR / AND (to use nfmark bitwise)
- documentation for libiptc
- port conntrack to IPv6 (code reuse?) [BB]
X port matches (owner, limit, multiport, owner) to IPv6 [RJ]
- make patch-o-matic more generic (any subdir), and reversible
- CONFIG_NF_IP_NAT_LOCAL
- fix and test the netfilter bridging stuff
X integrate the ipt_NETLINK target from gianni@ecsc.co.uk [HW]
X integrate PSD target / port it as match [HW]
- various NAT performance optimizations possible! (which? ask HW)
- ip_nat_ident module [FM]
- provide daily CVS snapshots via ftp [HW]
- 10.1.2.3.4 is accepted as a valid IP address by iptables -s / -d ?
- make iptables / ip6tables use the same codebase (as libiptc)

FUTURE extensions:
- conntrack / nat failover [HW]
- brainstorming about 2.5 conntrack code
- netlink interface for conntrack manipulation from userspace [HW]
- unified nfnetlink for queue,ulog,conntrack (and more?) (2.5 issue)
