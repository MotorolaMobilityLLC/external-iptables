This module, when combined with connection tracking, allows access to the
connection tracking state for this packet/connection.
.TP
[\fB!\fR] \fB--ctstate\fR \fIstatelist\fR
\fIstatelist\fR is a comma separated list of the connection states to match.
Possible states are listed below.
.TP
[\fB!\fR] \fB--ctproto\fR \fIl4proto\fR
Layer-4 protocol to match (by number or name)
.TP
[\fB!\fR] \fB--ctorigsrc\fR \fIaddress\fR[\fB/\fR\fImask\fR]
Match against original source address
.TP
[\fB!\fR] \fB--ctorigdst\fR \fIaddress\fR[\fB/\fR\fImask\fR]
Match against original destination address
.TP
[\fB!\fR] \fB--ctreplsrc\fR \fIaddress\fR[\fB/\fR\fImask\fR]
Match against reply source address
.TP
[\fB!\fR] \fB--ctrepldst\fR \fIaddress\fR[\fB/\fR\fImask\fR]
Match against reply destination address
.TP
[\fB!\fR] \fB--ctstatus\fR \fIstatelist\fR
\fIstatuslist\fR is a comma separated list of the connection statuses to match.
Possible statuses are listed below.
.TP
[\fB!\fR] \fB--ctexpire\fR \fItime\fR[\fB:\fR\fItime\fR]
Match remaining lifetime in seconds against given value or range of values
(inclusive)
.PP
States for \fB--ctstate\fR:
.TP
\fBINVALID\fR
meaning that the packet is associated with no known connection
.TP
\fBNEW\fR
meaning that the packet has started a new connection, or otherwise associated
with a connection which has not seen packets in both directions, and
.TP
\fBESTABLISHED\fR
meaning that the packet is associated with a connection which has seen packets
in both directions,
.TP
\fBRELATED\fR
meaning that the packet is starting a new connection, but is associated with an
existing connection, such as an FTP data transfer, or an ICMP error.
.TP
\fBSNAT\fR
A virtual state, matching if the original source address differs from the reply
destination.
.TP
\fBDNAT\fR
A virtual state, matching if the original destination differs from the reply
source.
.PP
Statuses for \fB--ctstatus\fR:
.TP
\fBNONE\fR
None of the below.
.TP
\fBEXPECTED\fR
This is an expected connection (i.e. a conntrack helper set it up)
.TP
\fBSEEN_REPLY\fR
Conntrack has seen packets in both directions.
.TP
\fBASSURED\fR
Conntrack entry should never be early-expired.
.TP
\fBCONFIRMED\fR
Connection is confirmed: originating packet has left box.
